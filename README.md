# gpsKaliope
This is the project of the GPS Kaliope using C++ I move this repository from my Bitbucket account


## C++ GPS software and Circuit Board.
The company was buying GPS from China to monitor its fleet, when the Pandemic broke out the Chinese platform broke down. Thus it was impossible to view and follow the cars, so I thought, wouldn't it be great if I could design my GPS add and personalize them with some special features that the company will need? So I started to figure it out, looking for all the information on the internet, learning copious information, and mustering all the components needed.
 It took me about 4 months and a lot of prototypes. I design the circuit board, and wrote all the code now in Visual Studio with the Visual-micro plugin, that IDE in contrast with the very basic Arduino IDE allowed me to outstrip the first approach I made with the "RPM Governor system", I learned a lot and now I was able to understand the familiarities and differences between each language how C++ manages its header files and source files, class declarations, inheritance, polymorphism, the differences between variables' demeanor, how an array works a little bit different in java PHP or C++, how indeed I need to clear from the memory an array when it would not be used anymore. 
The difference between pointers, how to pass a variable through reference or its explicit position in the memory, and why one char array was full of junky bits when it was being used in another method. (It took up to about 2 days, I investigated diligently till I understood that this array when used in another method didn't work in the same way as in Java). I learn how to communicate 2 or more processors through different protocols I2C, Serial communication, SPI, the differences between asynchronous and synchronous communication, and watching the screen of my oscilloscope if the signal wires were conveying the data correctly, inputs, outputs, interrupts. Now the actual system is equipped with a GPRS and GPS Module, SD Memory, RTC Clock, Li-ion Battery, and connection with the "RPM governor system" when you order the GPS through or webPage to turn off the Engine.



### Please i would really appreciate if you whatch all my video, just put it in 2x speed if it seems too long
